## 📖 Overview

**Hand Gesture Recognition** is a real-time system designed to detect and interpret hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques.... This project leverages the MediaPipe framework & OpenCV library to enhance human-computer interaction by replacing traditional input devices with intuitive hand gestures....

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Detection**: Capture and recognize hand gestures instantly using a webcam or built-in camera....
- **Virtual Mouse Control**: Perform mouse functions like clicking & scrolling using simple hand gestures
- **Touchless Interface**: Minimize physical contact with devices, ideal for pandemic scenarios and space-constrained environments
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for various applications, including robotics, AR/VR, and accessibility solutions....

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the project....!!
- **MediaPipe**: Framework for detecting and tracking hand landmarks
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing & computer vision tasks....
- **Pynput**: Python library for controlling and monitoring input devices....

## 🚀 Getting Started
